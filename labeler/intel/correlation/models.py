"""
Domain Models for the Threat Correlation Framework
===================================================
Standardised data-transfer objects (DTOs) used across all providers,
the scoring engine, and the correlation engine.

Every provider returns ``ThreatProviderResult`` with the same shape.
The correlation engine returns ``ThreatDecision``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider : str
        Human-readable name (e.g. ``"VirusTotal"``).
    malicious : bool
        Whether the provider considers this domain malicious.
    confidence : float
        Provider-level confidence in [0.0, 1.0].
    malicious_count : int
        Number of malicious reports / detections.
    harmless_count : int
        Number of harmless / clean reports.
    suspicious_count : int
        Number of suspicious reports.
    unavailable : bool
        ``True`` if the provider could not be reached, timed out, or
        returned an error.  When ``True`` the result contributes zero
        weight to the final score.
    error : str or None
        Human-readable error when ``unavailable=True``.
    found : bool
        ``True`` if the provider actually holds intelligence on this
        domain (e.g. VirusTotal returned an analysis record, OTX
        returned pulses).  ``False`` when the provider was reachable
        and responded successfully, but has **no record at all** for
        the domain (VT HTTP 404 / OTX "no pulses"/"unknown domain").
        This is distinct from ``unavailable`` (provider could not be
        queried) and from ``malicious=False`` (provider queried the
        domain and found it clean) — it means "no data either way".
    raw_data : dict
        Full raw API response for auditability and debugging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain : str
        The domain that was evaluated.
    malicious : bool
        Final verdict — ``True`` when the weighted score >= threshold.
    score : float
        Weighted score in [0.0, 1.0].  Sum of weights of all providers
        that voted malicious.
    confidence : float
        Average confidence across all *available* providers that voted
        malicious.  Independent of score.
    threshold : float

    provider_results : list[ThreatProviderResult]
        Full list of individual provider results for auditability.
    checked_at : datetime
        UTC timestamp of when the evaluation was performed.
    source : str
        Always ``"Threat Correlation Engine"``.
    metadata : dict
